# Project Homunculus: Primordial

This is an early public documentation and technical plan regarding Homunculus Project. Primordial is the first iteration of this project and designed as prototype. The final product will be recognized as another codename.

## What is Homunculus Project?

- **Simple answer**, it's artificial consciousness project. 
- **Complicated answer**, it's an unconventional, ambitious, and visionary approaches to combine insight from Machine Learning, Math, Neuroscience, and Jung's Cognitive Function to build an autonomous, self-learning, adaptable, introspective, consistent, and depth AI agents.

## Is this real, or we just trollin' people?

Yes, this is real. You can personally reach me for further explanation.

## Who fund this project? Is there any organization behind it?

Not yet, it's still an individual initiative without any hidden agenda from any organization. So, all funding come from my personal wallet.

## Is this project open-source?

Yes, it's all open. From documentation, technical planning, codebase, or even final product (the model weights) if we reach that point in development.

## How long the development timeline?

Very long, realistically I expect 10-20 years of development (if somehow no one interested in joining this project and I alone do all the things). But it can be accelerated if there's any community contribution.

## I want to read the details, is there any documentation I can read?

Yes, there is. I will put raw documentation in `documentation/raw` directory. It consist technical scientific papers, technical discussion, and any document before structural formatting.

The more easy to read documentation will be written along the way.
